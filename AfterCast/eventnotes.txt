The 1.10 patch appears to have changed the way in which spell events occur,
so here's a summary of what seems to happen now.

Gathering:

SPELLCAST_START
SPELLCAST_STOP

Gathering interruption:
SPELLCAST_START
<interupt>
SPELLCAST_STOP
SPELLCAST_INTERRUPTED (some fraction of a second thereafter)

Instant Cast Spell:
SPELLCAST_STOP

Normal Spell:
SPELLCAST_START
SPELLCAST_STOP

Normal Spell Interruption:
SPELLCAST_START
<interupt>
SPELLCAST_STOP
SPELLCAST_INTERRUPTED (some fraction of a second thereafter)

Channelled Spell:
SPELLCAST_CHANNEL_START
SPELLCAST_STOP (some number)
SPELLCAST_CHANNEL_STOP
SPELLCAST_STOP

Channelled Spell Interruption:
SPELLCAST_CHANNEL_START
SPELLCAST_STOP (possibly more than one)
SPELLCAST_CHANNEL_STOP

** MISSING -- Target death during cast **
