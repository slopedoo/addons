ImpulseBooster

This is a standalone addon for improving pre-WotLK clients' UI loading speed.
Pre-WotLK clients have their UI code tightly bound to display refresh rate, this addon works around this issue during loading time.

The addon's main function is split in 3 modes, depending on what is enabled when UI is loading:
* VSync is enabled: Disables VSync, Restarts graphics engine, UI loads faster, Enables VSync back and does a final graphics restart.
* VSync is disabled: Provides additional FPS boost during UI loading.
* IBSync: This addon's custom frame limiting mode, which keeps frame limit during playing, but disables it during loading without the need for restarting.

The addon is fully automated. The only UI part you will ever want to mess with is located into Video Options.
IBSync will be automatically shut down, if custom "maxFPS" value is being forced or incorrect refresh rate is detected.

Feature list:

* Fully automated UI loading speed boost.
* Additional frame limiting mode in video options: ImpulseBooster Sync (IBSync), which removes the need for restarts.
* Additional CPU tweak: Unlocks default CPU core affinity for pre-WotLK clients to all cores but the first one, instead of just first two cores. This setting is applied automatically and requires a client restart.
* Additional CPU tweak: Detects forced wrong timing methods and corrects them. Corrected setting will be applied after a client restart.

Cut features in 3.0:

* Lua garbage collection suppression while loading/reloading UI. This feature was removed due to negligible effect and being potentially unsafe for taints. This feature can be reintroduced on demand.

INSTALLATION:
* Windows users: Download and unzip regular edition package into "Interface\AddOns\" subfolder of your The Burning Crusade client.
* Linux (WINE) users: Download and unzip WINE edition package into "Data/" subfolder of your The Burning Crusade client.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

Its recommended for Linux users to use their respective dedicated edition, because this WINE bug doesn't allow this addon to be loaded first: https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34122
