1.0 Base Release

1.1
- Fix bug that would put feign deathed hunters at the top
- Introduce randomization, /gh set mode 2
- Introduce threshold. GodzillaHeal with not target someone unless they are missing more health than the threshold.
  You can set this via /gh set threshold 250. Default is 250.
- Introduce /gh cancel. If called while casting a heal initiated by Godzilla heal, and the target has moved above the threshold,
  the cast will cancel.

1.2
- Introduce 200 ms delay after a successful /gh cancel. This will mostly prevent the cancel cast bug.
- Fix accidently depending on Grid
- Fix bugs detecting where a healing spell is on your bar. Not sure if this is bulletproof yet.

1.3
- Introduce /ght, aka "GodzillaHeal Tank". Does not do any target selection, just casts the heal on your target. When used with /gh cancel, 
  GodzillaHeal will cancel the cast as late as possible. This is meant to be used for tank healing in raids, when you want to cancel cast
  if the target hasn't lost any health, but you want the cast to go as long as possible before canceling. Any healed casted as a result of /ght
  will have this "delayed" cancel behavior, as opposed to the behavior of heals intiated with /gh which will cancel the second the target does above
  the threshold.

1.4
- Fix target changing while casting; introduced in 1.3
- Fix blacklisting (also broken last version)

1.5
- Introduce HighestMissingHp mode. 
- Randomization is no longer tied to mode.
- Introduce /gh set randomize. Allows the randomization threshold to be customized.
- Introduce /gh watch. This allows you to watch for a spell cast and send a chat message as a result. This is a replacement for /say /cast macros
  which can spam a lot. /gh watch will only announce if/when the cast actually goes through, and doesn't require macros. It hooks into every
  possible way to cast a spell. /gh watch for syntax details.
- Fix bug which would target ghosts
- Introduce auto down rank. /gh set autodownrank.

1.6
- Introduce /gh debug. 
- Introduce filtering. Using wow macro style arguments: /gh [inc=*, ex=g3]. The matchs works like this: a unit must match both the exclusion and inclusion
  expression to be eligible for targetting. Both expressions follow the same rules for matching:
    - Star (*) matches everything
    - An empty string matches nothing
    - g1 matches any unit in group 1
    - Player names match player names, as you expect
    - An example: /gh [inc=g1 g2] Flash Heal. This will flash heal people in group 1 and 2.
  The use cases include bosses like vael and emeriss, where you really don't want to accidently heal  people in priest groups. 
  Other possibilities include groups that will definitely be out of range of you.

1.7
- Introduce new mode, "HighestMissingHpHealComm". This is the same as the regular highest missing hp mode, but also will add the incoming
  heal amount, as reported by the HealComm library (which is also bundled with Luna Unit Frames) into the calculations. The addon can only know about
  heals from other people who also have HealComm somehow. The use case here is, of course, more ways to avoid heal bombing one target. 

1.8
- Improved support for HOTs (Renew & Rejuvenation). Will only cast HOTs on players that are not currently affected by the specified HOT.
  Uses the same syntax, /gh Renew.

1.9
- Make HighestMissingHpHealComm actually work. Still probably needs testing in a real raid.
