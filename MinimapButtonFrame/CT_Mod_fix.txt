CT requires a little tweaking to get it working with MBF.

The button of CTMod2 has no name.

For it to work with MBF it needs one.

To do this you have to edit the CT_Core\CT_Core.lua file and change the line that says:

minimapFrame = module:getFrame(minimapFrameSkeleton);

to

minimapFrame = module:getFrame(minimapFrameSkeleton, nil, "CTMod2_MinimapButton");

That's the only way, unless you can convince the authors to give it a name of some sort.  :)
